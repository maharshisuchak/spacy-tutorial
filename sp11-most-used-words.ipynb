       "insupportable.  Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of\\\n",
       "dirt and poison, the way lay.  Yielding to his own disturbance of\\\n",
       "mind, and to his young companion's agitation, which became greater\\\n",
       "every instant, Mr. Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest.  Each of these\\\n",
       "stoppages was made at a doleful grating, by which any languishing\\\n",
       "good airs that were left uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all\\\n",
       "spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in.  Through the rusted\\\n",
       "bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were caught of the jumbled\\\n",
       "neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer or lower than the\\\n",
       "summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any promise on it\\\n",

       "\"You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?\"\\\n",
       "\\\n",
       "\"I think it necessary to turn the key.\"  Monsieur Defarge whispered it\\\n",

       "\\\n",
       "\"Why?\"\\\n",
       "\\\n",
       "\"Why!  Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be\\\n",

       "\\\n",
       "This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word\\\n",
       "of it had reached the young lady's ears.  But, by this time she\\\n",
       "trembled under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep\\\n",
       "anxiety, and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt\\\n",
       "it incumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.\\\n",
       "\\\n",
       "\"Courage, dear miss!  Courage!  Business!  The worst will be over\\\n",

       "They went up slowly and softly.  The staircase was short, and they\\\n",
       "were soon at the top.  There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they\\\n",

       "close together at the side of a door, and who were intently looking\\\n",
       "into the room to which the door belonged, through some chinks or\\\n",
       "holes in the wall.  On hearing footsteps close at hand, these three\\\n",
       "turned, and rose, and showed themselves to be the three of one name\\\n",

       "With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked\\\n",
       "in through the crevice in the wall.  Soon raising his head again, he\\\n",
       "struck twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object\\\n",
       "than to make a noise there.  With the same intention, he drew the key\\\n",
       "across it, three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the\\\n",

       "\\\n",

       "more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.\\\n",
       "\\\n",
       "He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter.\\\n",

       "\\\n",
       "\"A-a-a-business, business!\" he urged, with a moisture that was not of\\\n",

       "from the street:  unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces,\\\n",
       "like any other door of French construction.  To exclude the cold, one\\\n",
       "half of this door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a\\\n",
       "very little way.  Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through\\\n",

       "towards the door, and his face towards the window where the keeper of\\\n",
       "the wine-shop stood looking at him, a white-haired man sat on a low\\\n",

       "After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the\\\n",

       "had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.\\\n",
       "\\\n",
       "The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful.  It was not the\\\n",
       "faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no\\\n",
       "doubt had their part in it.  Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it\\\n",
       "was the faintness of solitude and disuse.  It was like the last\\\n",
       "feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago.  So entirely had it\\\n",
       "lost the life and resonance of the human voice, that it affected the\\\n",
       "senses like a once beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak\\\n",
       "stain.  So sunken and suppressed it was, that it was like a voice\\\n",
       "underground.  So expressive it was, of a hopeless and lost creature,\\\n",
       "that a famished traveller, wearied out by lonely wandering in a\\\n",
       "wilderness, would have remembered home and friends in such a tone\\\n",
       "before lying down to die.\\\n",
       "\\\n",
       "Some minutes of silent work had passed:  and the haggard eyes had\\\n",
       "looked up again:  not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull\\\n",
       "mechanical perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only\\\n",
       "visitor they were aware of had stood, was not yet empty.\\\n",
       "\\\n",
       "\"I want,\" said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the\\\n",

       "\\\n",
       "The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening,\\\n",

       "\\\n",
       "The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that\\\n",
       "angle for the time.  A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and\\\n",
       "showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in\\\n",
       "his labour.  His few common tools and various scraps of leather were\\\n",
       "at his feet and on his bench.  He had a white beard, raggedly cut,\\\n",
       "but not very long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes.  The\\\n",
       "hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look\\\n",
       "large, under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair,\\\n",
       "though they had been really otherwise; but, they were naturally\\\n",
       "large, and looked unnaturally so.  His yellow rags of shirt lay open\\\n",
       "at the throat, and showed his body to be withered and worn.  He, and\\\n",
       "his old canvas frock, and his loose stockings, and all his poor\\\n",
       "tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion from direct light and\\\n",
       "air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment-yellow, that\\\n",
       "it would have been hard to say which was which.\\\n",
       "\\\n",
       "He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very\\\n",
       "bones of it seemed transparent.  So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant\\\n",
       "gaze, pausing in his work.  He never looked at the figure before him,\\\n",
       "without first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as\\\n",
       "if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound; he never\\\n",

       "shoemaker looked up.  He showed no surprise at seeing another figure,\\\n",
       "but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as\\\n",
       "he looked at it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-\\\n",
       "colour), and then the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent\\\n",
       "over the shoe.  The look and the action had occupied but an instant.\\\n",
       "\\\n",
       "\"You have a visitor, you see,\" said Monsieur Defarge.\\\n",
       "\\\n",

       "\\\n",
       "Mr. Lorry took it in his hand.\\\n",

       "\"Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker's name.\"\\\n",
       "\\\n",
       "There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:\\\n",
       "\\\n",
       "\"I forget what it was you asked me.  What did you say?\"\\\n",
       "\\\n",
       "\"I said, couldn't you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur's information?\"\\\n",
       "\\\n",
       "\"It is a lady's shoe.  It is a young lady's walking-shoe.  It is in the\\\n",
       "present mode.  I never saw the mode.  I have had a pattern in my hand.\"\\\n",
       "He glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.\\\n",
       "\\\n",
       "\"And the maker's name?\" said Defarge.\\\n",
       "\\\n",
       "Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand\\\n",
       "in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the\\\n",
       "hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin,\\\n",
       "and so on in regular changes, without a moment's intermission.\\\n",
       "The task of recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always\\\n",
       "sank when he had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person\\\n",
       "from a swoon, or endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure,\\\n",
       "to stay the spirit of a fast-dying man.\\\n",

       "the question to him:  but as no help came from that quarter, they\\\n",

       "\\\n",
       "Darkness had fatten on him in its place.  He looked at the two, less\\\n",
