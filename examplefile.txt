More recently, sensor technology and real-time data collection have produced bumper crops of employee information for companies. Now managers can access second-by-second feedback on what a worker is doing and, to some extent, what a worker is feeling. Data from emails, chats, and calendar systems can be analyzed alongside traditional HR data. Sensors can gather incredibly granular data on workers’ habits — everything from who speaks with whom, how much people interrupt one another, where they spend time, and even their stress levels. And as ID badges and office furniture join the internet of things, the information that companies have on their workers will expand by orders of magnitude. HR departments now have the potential to know nearly everything about employees.
